## Model Used :


The model used is the [IRRCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04241.pdf). It uses Residual connections in addition to the [IRCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07709) model which adds the inputs at each step to the feature maps extracted by the IRCNN block after passing them through (1,1) convolutional filters to equate their dimensions .
